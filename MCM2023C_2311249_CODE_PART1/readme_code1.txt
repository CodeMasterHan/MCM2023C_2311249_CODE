This  is a JupyterNotebook file, which comprehensively completes a number of modeling requirements in the title, 
including data visualization, principal component analysis, Skewness-Kurtosis normality test, normal distribution fitting,
 least squares fitting logistic function, spearman correlation test, KMeans++clustering, etc. I have annotated the key 
specific functions in each code block.
